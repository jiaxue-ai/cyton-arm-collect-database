## source code and generated files to control cyton arm image outside

Jia Xue

###   Introduction

The code to control cyton-gamma-300 robot arm. 

### Get Started
pre-install: visual studio 2013 professional, cMake, Robai cytonViewer, pylon4 camera software suit in windows system.

I already attached my generated cytonExampleGUIPlugin.ecp with pose and sequence information in the arm_pose_generated_file folder, if you need to make some adjustment: When finish downloading Robai, add the code into Robai/Cyton Gamma.../cyton/examples/src/cytonExampleGUIPlugin
Before compile code in visual studio, make sure use cMake to build the project, for detail, please see the [manual](http://outgoing.energid.info/cyton/Documentation%20WIP/Doxygen%20Compiled/index.html)
